# TECHIN512-Final-Project
My game is a handheld reinterpretation of a classic claw machine. The goal is to control a digital claw and successfully capture targets under different constraints as the game difficulty increases. The game includes three difficulty modes, each introducing new mechanics and pressure to keep the player engaged.
	•	Easy Mode: The target remains stationary, and the player has a simple time limit to grab it.
	•	Medium Mode: The claw is still stationary, but a life system is introduced — the player can only miss up to three times before receiving a Game Over.
	•	Hard Mode: The target moves across the screen, and the player must capture a set number of targets within the time limit while still managing the three-life system.

The physical design also echoes a real claw machine. The rotary encoder functions like the joystick, letting players move the claw left and right, while a button press triggers the “grab” action. This combination of hardware interaction and on-screen gameplay recreates the tactile feel of an arcade claw machine in a compact embedded device.
